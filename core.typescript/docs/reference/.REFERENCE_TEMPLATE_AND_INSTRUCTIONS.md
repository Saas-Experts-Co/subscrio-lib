# Service Reference Template

All service-specific reference files under `docs/reference/` must follow this structure to guarantee consistent coverage and render cleanly in Markdown previews.

## COPY ALL THESE FILES TO THE DOCS project (mkdocs) ./docs/reference folder

## 1. Service Overview
- **Purpose**: One short paragraph describing what the service manages.
- **Scope**: Bulleted reminders about key domains, invariants, or dependencies.

## 2. Accessing the Service
Provide a minimal TypeScript snippet that shows how to import/initialize `Subscrio` and reach the service instance (e.g., `const { products } = subscrio;`).

## 3. Method Catalog
A table summarizing every public method exposed by the service. Columns:
- `Method`
- `Description`
- `Returns`

## 4. Method Reference (repeat per method, in declaration order)
Each method section must include the following subsections:

1. **Description**: 2-3 sentences about the intent and when to call it.
2. **Signature**: Inline TypeScript code block that matches the actual method declaration.
3. **Inputs**: Markdown table with columns `Name`, `Type`, `Required`, `Description`. Include validation rules, defaults, and DTO references.
4. **Input Properties**: Bullet list explaining any complex inputs. If the DTO is only used by this method, describe its fields inline here instead of referencing a shared DTO section.
5. **Returns**: Text describing the fulfilled promise value (type, contents, shape) and any side effects.
6. **Return Properties**: Bullet list summarizing returned DTO/object fields; include inline details when the type is method-specific.
7. **Expected Results**: Bulleted list describing what the method does when successful (e.g., “persists entity”, “recalculates status”).
8. **Potential Errors**: Table with columns `Error` and `When it is thrown`. List every error class the implementation can emit and the condition.
9. **Example**: Short TypeScript snippet demonstrating realistic usage. Prefer actual DTO structures; keep under ~15 lines.

## 5. DTO Reference (optional)
Only include this section when a DTO is shared by multiple methods or across services. Otherwise, rely on the inline “Input Properties” / “Return Properties” tables for field-level documentation.

## 6. Related Workflows
Optional section to call out domain rules, relationships, or helper services that callers must consider (e.g., “Products must exist before Plans”). Use bullet points for clarity.

> **Enforcement**: Do not skip any of the sections above. Even if a method has no inputs or errors, include the subsection with an explicit note (e.g., “None”). Whenever a method mentions a DTO or helper defined elsewhere on the page, add an inline link so readers can jump to the detailed definition. This template is the contract reviewers will use.
