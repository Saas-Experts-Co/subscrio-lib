## Toast Alerts
Always prompt the developer before injecting toast alerts into the UI to ensure they are necessary and appropriate for the user experience.

Never use browser prompts for confirm dialogs or alerts. Always use custom dialogs.

If you do inject a toast alert, ensure it never displayes for more than 4 seconds.
